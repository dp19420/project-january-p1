            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <p>Narmer was well-regarded by later Egyptian pharaohs and is considered the founder of the dynastic period that would last for millennia. His tomb, located near Abydos, is surprisingly modest compared to those of later pharaohs.
                Narmer's reign laid the foundation for the great Egyptian civilization that would follow, establishing many of the cultural, religious, and political traditions that would define ancient Egypt for thousands of years</p>
